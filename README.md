# 2048 Game

Clone of the classic 2048 game implemented using tkinter

## Todo

- refactor: use direction enum rather than magic strings
- refactor: use table enum holding addends and ranges rather than multiple dicts
- fix: _compress and _merge functions
- feat: if yes to play again, call color board when reset
- feat: improve check win to validate if moves are possible even if board is full
